## 1. The Battlefield: Current State
We have uncovered a polarized market with a massive gap in the middle.

| Competitor | Strategy | Channel Enabler | Weakness |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **PipeOps** | **Community / Organic** | Discord, Hackathons | **Zero Paid Presence.** Vulnerable to paid search sniping. |
| **Salus Cloud** | **Tech Feature Sell** | Direct/Enterprise | **Engineer-Focus.** Selling "Scanning", not "Business Safety". |
| **Cloudsania** | **Business Outcome** | Paid Social / Search | **Opportunity:** Own the "Simplicity & Profit" narrative. |

## 4. Immediate Action Items
1.  **Bid on "PipeOps" Brand Keywords:** They aren't protecting their brand on Google Ads. Cheap clicks.
2.  **Launch "Unified Billing" Meta Ads:** Retarget users interested in "cPanel" or "WHMCS" (Agency tools).
