# Salus Cloud - Deep Competitor Profile
**Date:** 2026-01-26
**Status:** Phase 2 Deep Dive Complete

> [!WARNING]
> **Identity Conflict Detected:** Search results often mix up "Salus Cloud" (the DevOps startup) with "Salus3" (UK Pre-hospital care software). This profile focuses strictly on the **DevOps/DevSecOps** entity spun out of Deimos.

## 1. Top-Level Overview
- **Origin:** Spun out of **Deimos** (leading African Cloud Consultancy).
- **Headquarters:** Likely South Africa / Remote (Deimos footprint).
- **Funding:** **$3.7M Seed** (Co-led by Atlantica Ventures & P1 Ventures).
- **Core Value Prop:** "AI-Native DevSecOps." Focuses on security automation and compliance, positioning higher up the value chain than PipeOps.

## 2. Product Capabilities (Verified)
- **Deployment:** "Zero-touch" deployments using AI to automate configuration.
- **Security (The "Sec" in DevSecOps):**
    - Built-in vulnerability remediation (AI-driven).
    - CI/CD pipelines with integrated security checks.
    - *Note:* Specifics like WAF/DDoS are implied by the Deimos partnership (Google Cloud security stack) but not explicitly detailed as standalone features.
- **Infrastructure:** Built on top of **Google Cloud** (Vertex AI integration mentioned).
- **AI Integration:** Uses AI for "self-healing" code, vulnerability patching, and cost optimization.

## 3. Pricing Model
**Model:** "Pay-as-you-code" (Usage-based) + Subscription.
- **Tiers:**
    - **Free/Hobby:** Up to 2 users, limited retention.
    - **Developer:** ~$29/user/mo.
    - **Team:** ~$99/mo (5 users).
    - **Enterprise:** Custom (AWS Marketplace listing at **$25k/yr** implies robust enterprise focus).
- **Billing:** Splits cloud infrastructure costs from platform fees (unlike Heroku's bundled markup).

## 4. Market Positioning
- **Target Audience:** Funded Startups & SMEs in Fintech/E-commerce who need compliance but can't afford a CISO or dedicated DevSecOps team.
- **Messaging:** "Secure software delivery," "Peace of mind."
- **Vs PipeOps:** Salus is **Premium/Standard**. PipeOps is **Budget/entry-level**. Salus sells "Safety/Security," PipeOps sells "Simplicity/Cost."

## 5. Customer Evidence
- **Key Partners:** Deimos (Parent/Partner).
- **Case Studies:** Sparse public naming. Most "case studies" found were for the medical software (false positives).
- **VenueX:** User suggested link ($1.2M raise). *Investigation:* No direct public link found yet between VenueX and Salus, but sharing investors (Atlantica?) or being a portfolio company is possible.

## 6. Gaps & Weaknesses (Attack Vectors)
- **Identity Crisis:** SEO is messy (confused with medical software).
- **Complexity:** "DevSecOps" is a heavier sell than "Deploy App." Might scare off simple users.
- **Documentation:** Public docs are harder to find/navigate than Vercel/Heroku.

## 7. Strategic Recommendations for Cloudsania
- **Positioning:** Don't fight them on "Security" (they have Deimos backing). Fight them on **"Joy of Use."**
- **Pricing:** Our $XX plans should undercut their $99 team plan while offering better DX.
- **Market:** Let them have the heavy fintechs; we take the creative agencies and fast-moving startups.
