# Phase 1 Synthesis Report: Competitor Discovery
**Date:** 2026-01-26
**Status:** Phase 1 Complete

## Executive Summary
Phase 1 discovery confirms the initial hypothesis: The African "Modern PaaS" market is a massive **White Space**.
- **Direct Competitors:** Only **2** credible "modern" platforms exist (PipeOps, Salus Cloud).
- **The Rest:** 90% of the market is dominated by "Legacy IaaS" (VPS/cPanel providers) or "Global Giants" (Heroku/Vercel).
- **Opportunity:** There is no dominant "Vercel for Africa" yet. PipeOps is the low-end entry, Salus Cloud is the high-end enterprise/security play. Cloudsania has a clear lane in the middle (Professional/Agency).

## The Shortlist (Candidates for Phase 2 Deep Dive)
We filtered 25+ raw search results down to these key profiles.

| Candidate | Category | Threat Level | Why Profile? |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **PipeOps** | Modern PaaS | 🔴 High | Direct "No-Code/DevOps" competitor. Low price point ($10/mo) undercuts us. |
| **Salus Cloud** | AI/DevSecOps | 🟡 Medium | High-end positioning ($99/mo). Focuses on "Security" vs our "Simplicity". |
| **Convox** | Private PaaS | 🟠 Medium | The "Private Heroku" model (BYOC) we should benchmark against. |
| **Angani** | Legacy IaaS | 🟢 Low | Representative of the "Old Guard" (Kenya). Useful for "Before/After" messaging. |
| **CloudAfrica** | Legacy IaaS | 🟢 Low | South African benchmark for "Local Cloud" performance claims. |

## Rejected Candidates (False Positives / Irrelevant)
- **DPLYR:** Confirmed as an R data tool, not a startup.
- **Wusob/Cybercloud:** Traditional IT shops masking as PaaS. Not viable for modern devs.

## Next Steps (Phase 2: Deep Profiling)
We will now conduct 8-category deep dives on the Shortlist, focusing on:
1.  **PipeOps:** Verification of their "Multi-Cloud" claims (is it just EC2 wrappers?).
2.  **Salus Cloud:** Unpacking the "AI" value prop—is it real?
3.  **Convox:** Analyzing their V3 "Cloud Machines" pricing model.
