## Pre-Event: 4-Week Promotion Timeline

### Week 4 (Teaser Phase)

**Goal:** Gauge interest, build anticipation

**LinkedIn Post (Monday):**
```
What's the #1 reason Lagos agencies lose profit margins?

After 100+ conversations, it's not finding clients. It's managing their servers.

We're planning something to fix this infrastructure mess forever.

Should we do:
🔥 Agency No-Ops Masterclass
💼 Multi-Client Dashboard Clinic
🚀 Deploy Automation Workshop

Vote in comments 👇
```

**Twitter Thread (Wednesday):**
```
We're planning something for Lagos agencies...

Managing 20-50 client sites shouldn't require:
• 12 different logins
• Manual server provisioning
• Late-night downtime fixes
• DevOps hiring

Should we host a workshop to fix this? 🤔

Reply with YES if you'd attend.
```

**WhatsApp Status (Friday):**
```

Tired of cPanel chaos?
Tired of AWS overwhelm?
Tired of putting out fires?

We're planning a hands-on workshop.
DM for early access.

[FREE RESOURCE] The Agency "No-Ops" Checklist

Hey fam 👋

I put together a checklist for agencies who want to stop wasting time on server management:
✓ How to organize 50+ projects without 50+ AWS accounts

Figured it would help the agency owners here.
