Features

## Tired of Slow Cloud Setups?

What takes weeks can now happen in minutes. Cloudsania makes it easy to get started, scale faster, and keep things simple along the way.

#### App Services

With pre-configured stacks, you can deploy and manage your cloud-native apps faster, with no DevOps hassle.

#### Security & Compliance

Stay compliant from day one with automated checks and secure-by-default infrastructure. Avoid costly missteps as you scale.

#### Monitoring

See it all, in real time. Monitor your app’s performance and system health, stay ahead of downtime, and keep your users happy.

As a developer, I used to waste so much time setting up CI/CD pipelines and debugging infrastructure issues. Cloudsania automated all of that. Now, I just push my code and focus on building features. It feels like having an extra DevOps teammate on the team.

As a non-technical founder, I was worried about the complexity of managing our cloud. With Cloudsania, I set up our MVP in days instead of weeks, without hiring a DevOps engineer. The built-in compliance also gave our investors peace of mind
