## 6. Message Hierarchy (Per Channel)

### Homepage

1. **Hero:** Universal headline + subheadline
2. **Section 2:** Segment switcher (Agencies / Builders / Developers)
3. **Section 3:** Differentiation pillars (5 cards)
4. **Section 4:** Proof points (logos, testimonials, uptime)
5. **Section 5:** Pricing CTA

### Twitter/X

| Post Type | Message Priority |
|:---|:---|
| Pain posts | Use customer language ("FUNCTION_INVOCATION_TIMEOUT", "Card declined") |
| Solution posts | Lead with benefit ("Deploy in 60 seconds") |
| Social proof | Quote customer testimonials |

### Sales Calls (AI Builders)

1. Open with: "What are you deploying — agents, an LLM app, something else?"
2. Pain discovery: "What's the gap between your working code and getting it live? How long does deployment take you?"
3. Solution intro: "What if you could push your repo and it's live — no Dockerfiles, no YAML, no CI config?"
4. Differentiation: "Capped pricing at $39/user. No serverless timeouts. Same environment from dev to prod."
5. Close: "Want to deploy your current project in the next 15 minutes? Free trial, local payment available."

### Sales Calls (Agencies)

1. Open with: "How many client sites are you managing today?"
2. Pain discovery: "What happens when one goes down at 2AM?"
3. Solution intro: "What if you could see all 40 in one dashboard?"
4. Differentiation: "99.9% uptime guarantee and white-label portal included."
5. Close: "Want to try with 3 clients for 14 days free? Local payment accepted."

## 7. Words to Use vs. Avoid

### ✅ USE (Customer Language)

| Term | Why |
|:---|:---|
| "Deploy" | Standard developer term |
| "Dashboard" | Clear, non-technical |
| "Paystack", "Naira" | Shows local understanding (current/live) |
| "Dollar card" | Pain trigger phrase |
| "No SSH needed" | Removes fear |

### ❌ AVOID (Jargon)

| Term | Alternative |
|:---|:---|
| "Orchestration" | "Deployment automation" |
| "Control Plane" | Acceptable for technical audiences. Use "Cloud deployment platform" for non-technical. |
| "Konstacks" | Explain first: "Pre-built templates called Konstacks" |
| "BYO-Credits" | "Use your own cloud credits" |
