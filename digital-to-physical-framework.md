# Digital-to-Physical Conversion Framework

**Purpose:** Leverage digital channels to drive qualified attendance at physical touchpoints  
**Core Principle:** Digital reach × Physical depth = Compounding network effects  
**Positioning Alignment:** Simplicity First • No-Ops for Agencies • BYOC (Your Cloud, Our Interface)  
**Date:** January 2026

---

## Executive Summary

### **The Challenge:**
Physical events are high-value but low-reach. Digital content is high-reach but low-depth. How do we combine them?

### **The Solution:**
Use digital channels as **acquisition funnels** for physical events, then use physical events to create **digital content** that fuels the next cycle.

### **The Flywheel:**
```
DIGITAL CONTENT (blog, social, email)
    ↓
AWARENESS (10,000 reach)
    ↓
EVENT PROMOTION (targeted to segment)
    ↓
PHYSICAL ATTENDANCE (100 qualified attendees)
    ↓
DEEP RELATIONSHIPS (1-on-1 conversations)
    ↓
CONTENT CREATION (event recap, testimonials)
    ↓
DIGITAL DISTRIBUTION (10,000+ reach)
    ↓
REPEAT (next event bigger, better qualified)
```

### **Success Metrics:**
- **Digital → Physical Conversion:** 5-10% of digital audience attends physical events
- **Physical → Digital Amplification:** 1 physical attendee = 10 digital shares
- **Network Effect:** Each cycle grows digital audience by 20-30%
