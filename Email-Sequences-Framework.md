## 8. Phygital Email Integration

### Channel Category-Based Nurture Intensity

Different acquisition channels produce leads with different intent levels. Email nurture intensity varies accordingly.

#### Intensity Framework

| Source Category | Intensity Level | Email Count | Frequency | Content Focus | CTA Style |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| **Owned** (Your events, email list) | Light | 4-5 emails | Every 3 days | Action-focused | Direct ("Start now") |
| **Borrowed** (Partner events, communities) | Medium | 6-7 emails | Every 2 days | Relationship + Action | Balanced ("See how") |
| **Paid** (Conference booth, ads) | Heavy | 8-10 emails | Every 1.5 days | Education → Trust → Action | Soft progression |

#### Owned Channel Sequence (Light Intensity)

**Entry:** Your workshop, bootcamp, office hours, email subscriber
**Assumption:** High intent - already experienced the product/brand

| Email | Delay | Focus | CTA |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| **1** | Immediate | Welcome + Quick Start | "Deploy in 2 mins" |
| **2** | Day 3 | Key feature highlight | "Try [feature]" |
| **3** | Day 6 | Use case for their segment | "See how [similar company] uses it" |
| **4** | Day 10 | Upgrade nudge | "Ready to upgrade?" |
| **5** | Day 14 | Trial ending + offer | "Don't lose your progress" |

---

#### Borrowed Channel Sequence (Medium Intensity)

**Entry:** Partner event, community post, referral, meetup
**Assumption:** Medium intent - trust transferred from source

| **2** | Day 2 | Positioning (what makes us different) | "See the difference" |

| **7** | Day 14 | Last chance | "Don't miss out" |

---

#### Paid Channel Sequence (Heavy Intensity)

**Entry:** Conference booth, sponsored event, paid ads
**Assumption:** Lower intent - needs education and trust building

| Email | Delay | Focus | CTA |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| **1** | Immediate | Welcome + Event follow-up | "Great meeting you at [Event]" |
| **2** | Day 1.5 | Pain point validation | "Is [pain point] slowing you down?" |
| **3** | Day 3 | Education (problem → solution) | "Why modern deployment matters" |
| **4** | Day 4.5 | Social proof | "How developers like you solved this" |
| **5** | Day 6 | Feature deep-dive | "See the platform in action" |
| **6** | Day 7.5 | Case study | "[Company] reduced deploy time by 80%" |
| **7** | Day 9 | Objection handling | "Common concerns (and answers)" |

| **9** | Day 13 | Trial nudge | "Ready to try?" |

### CRM Tagging Strategy

**Required Tags for Event Leads:**

```
source_category: owned | borrowed | paid
source_channel: workshop | meetup | conference | office_hours | booth
source_event: lsw2026 | wordcamp-lagos | devfest-lagos | etc.
source_attribution: cloudsania-team | cm-lagos | partner-name
customer_segment: agency | ai-native | startup | developer | student
pain_point: from quiz response
nurture_intensity: light | medium | heavy
event_variant: true | false
```

**Automation Rules:**

```javascript
// Set nurture intensity based on source category
IF source_category == "owned" THEN nurture_intensity = "light"
IF source_category == "borrowed" THEN nurture_intensity = "medium"
IF source_category == "paid" THEN nurture_intensity = "heavy"

// Route to correct sequence variant
IF event_variant == true AND nurture_intensity == "light"
    THEN sequence = "onboarding_event_light"

IF event_variant == true AND nurture_intensity == "medium"
    THEN sequence = "onboarding_event_medium"

IF event_variant == true AND nurture_intensity == "heavy"
    THEN sequence = "onboarding_event_heavy"
```
