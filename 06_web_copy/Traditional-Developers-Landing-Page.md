### Section 1: Hero - BEFORE (Current State Recognition)

**Purpose:** Immediate empathy and pain recognition

**Psychology Applied:** Regret Aversion + Empathy

**Copy:**

**Headline (Empathy-First - from Framework §3.3):**
> You're not behind. Your stack just needs a modern runway.

**Subheadline:**

**Primary CTA:**
- "Start Free Trial" (14 days, no credit card)
- Trust signal below: "Built for 5,000+ PHP and Laravel developers"

**Secondary CTA:**
- "See How It Works" (scroll to demo)

**Empathy Statement (below CTA):**
> **You know your craft.** You build solid applications. You just want to deploy them without learning Kubernetes. That's fair.

**Visual Guidance:**

## Psychological Framework Deep Dive

### Primary: Regret Aversion (Fear of Obsolescence)
**Application:**
- **Section 1 (Hero):** "You're not behind" - addresses fear directly
- **Section 2 (Before):** "The industry moved. You didn't get the memo." - articulates regret
- **Section 8 (Final CTA):** "Don't get left behind" - motivates action

**Why it works for Traditional Developers:**
- Canvas 3 shows **Emotional Job (Critical):** "Overcome fear of obsolescence"
- **Emotional Job (Critical):** "Eliminate command-line anxiety"
- Regret Aversion taps into fear of being left behind professionally

### Secondary: Authority (We Understand Your Journey)
**Application:**
- **Section 1:** Empathy statement: "You know your craft. You build solid applications."
- **Section 2:** Deep understanding of cPanel nostalgia, AWS complexity
- **Section 4:** "The bridge from cPanel to modern deployment" - positioning as guide

**Why it works for Traditional Developers:**
- Emotional-first segment needs to feel understood
- Authority = credibility as a guide, not a vendor
- "We've walked this path" resonates more than "We're the best"

### Tertiary: Similarity Bias (Developers Like You)
**Application:**
- **Section 7:** Testimonials from PHP/Laravel developers with years of experience
- **Section 2:** "5,000+ PHP and Laravel developers felt the same way"
- **Section 8:** "Join 5,000+ PHP and Laravel developers"

**Why it works for Traditional Developers:**
- Seeing similar developers succeed = safety signal
- Years of experience in testimonials = credibility
- "Developers like you" = belonging, not isolation

## A/B Test Recommendations

### Test 1: Hero Headline (Empathy vs Outcome)
- **Variant A (Current):** "You're not behind. Your stack just needs a modern runway." (Empathy)
- **Variant B:** "Deploy Laravel apps with Git push. No Kubernetes. No Docker." (Outcome)
- **Hypothesis:** Variant A (empathy) will resonate more given Emotional-First JTBD

### Test 2: Pain Section Tone

- **Variant B:** Neutral tone ("Modern deployment has changed. Here's what's different.")
- **Hypothesis:** Empathetic tone may build stronger connection

### Test 3: Comparison Table Position
- **Variant A (Current):** Section 6 (after How It Works)
- **Variant B:** Section 3 (after Pain Recognition)
- **Hypothesis:** Early positioning may clarify "middle path" value proposition

### Test 4: CTA Copy
- **Variant A:** "Start Free Trial"
- **Variant B:** "Deploy Your First App Free"
- **Variant C:** "Move Forward Today"
- **Hypothesis:** Variant C (regret aversion framing) may increase conversion
