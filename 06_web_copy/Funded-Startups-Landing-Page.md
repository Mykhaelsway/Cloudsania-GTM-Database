## Psychological Framework Deep Dive

### Primary: Authority (Compliance Credibility)
**Application:**
- **Section 1 (Hero):** Authority badges (SOC 2, ISO 27001, GDPR-ready)
- **Section 2 (Pain):** Deep understanding of regulatory challenges
- **Section 3 (Authority Proof):** Compliance features with framework alignment

**Why it works for Funded Startups:**
- Canvas 4 shows **Social Job (Critical):** "Satisfy investor due diligence"
- **Functional Job (Critical):** "Ensure data residency compliance"
- Authority signals = credibility with investors and regulators

### Secondary: Loss Aversion (Regulatory & Financial Risk)
**Application:**
- **Section 2:** Regulatory fines, failed audits, investor rejection
- **Section 4:** Runway impact of DevOps hire ($207k Year 1)
- **Section 5:** Deployment fear, compliance risk

**Why it works for Funded Startups:**
- Canvas 4 Pain: **High DevOps Personnel Costs (10/10)** - highest severity
- **Data Residency/Compliance Risk (9/10)** - regulatory pressure
- Loss Aversion taps into fear of wasted runway and failed audits

### Tertiary: Anchoring (Cost Comparison)
**Application:**
- **Section 4:** $24k DevOps salary anchors perception
- **Platform cost ($1,188/year)** feels trivial by comparison
- **Runway Impact:** "Extend runway by 6 months" reframes cost as time

**Why it works for Funded Startups:**
- Canvas 4 Pain: **High DevOps Personnel Costs (10/10)** - critical pain
- Startups are runway-conscious, cost-sensitive
- Anchoring makes ROI immediately obvious (175x)
