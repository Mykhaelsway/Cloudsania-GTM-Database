## 2026-02-05

**Build in Public Program Structure:**
- ✅ Program includes Cursor/Antigravity teachings ("Idea to Product" curriculum)
- ✅ 4-week cohort format with weekly live sessions or recorded tutorials
- ✅ Success incentives: Builder Spotlight, free Cloudsania tier (TBD period), case study feature
- ✅ Success criteria: Deployed to production, 3+ updates shipped, 4/4 weekly build logs

**Demo Shop Clarification:**
- ✅ "Demo Shop" = demo workshop (hands-on deployment sessions)
- ❌ NOT permanent physical presence at hubs

**Geographic Focus:**
- ✅ Phase 0-1: Lagos only (not Nairobi, Accra)
- ✅ Phase 2-3: Continue Lagos focus, expand later

**Hub Partnerships:**
- ✅ No specific hub names in roadmaps yet (generic "tech hubs")
- ✅ Will create partner list later

**Token Optimization:**
- ✅ Avoid tables in markdown outputs (use annotated bullet points)
- ✅ Use hybrid structure for large documents (master index + modular chunks)
- ✅ Reference frameworks without repeating full details
- ✅ Create knowledge base files for fresh chat sessions

**Messaging Framework Audit:**
- ✅ Fixed pricing discrepancies (Free tier exists, paid tiers start at $39/month)

## Strategic Decisions

**Segment Allocation:**
- Agencies: 47% (Revenue Engine)
- AI Natives: 33% (Marketing Engine)
- Funded Startups: 13% (Revenue + Credibility Engine)
- Traditional Devs: 7% (Market Education Engine)

**Phygital Flywheel Thesis:**
- AI Natives create content → SEO authority → Community growth → Physical events → Agency/Startup discovery → Paid conversions → Case studies → Content fuel → REPEAT

**Champions Program:**
- Launch Week 13 (Phase 1)
- Criteria: 2+ months active, 3+ projects shipped
- Benefits: Free Pro tier, badge, priority support
- Requirements: 1 post/month, 1 community answer/week

**Agency Masterclass Format:**
- Half-day event (9am-5pm)
- Hands-on sessions (connect cloud, multi-org setup)
- 4-week pre-event promotion timeline
- Target: 30 attendees → 15 connect → 8 paid = $312 MRR per event
