- **Funding History:** 
  - Raised venture capital (confirmed by search results mentioning investors, but specific rounds/amounts not publicly disclosed on company site as of Feb 2026)
  - Note: Multiple companies named "Porter" exist. The porter.run PaaS platform is distinct from Porter (helloporter.com - healthcare member engagement) and Porter Metrics (portermetrics.com - analytics). Research focused on porter.run.
- **Disclosed Revenue or ARR:** Not publicly available as of Feb 2026
- **Team Size:** 11-50 employees (Source: getlago.com/blog/porter-billing, accessed Feb 2026)
- **Key Leadership:** 
  - Justin Rhee - Founder (Source: getlago.com/blog/porter-billing, accessed Feb 2026)
  - Mauricio Araujo - Engineer (Source: getlago.com/blog/porter-billing, accessed Feb 2026)

#### Target Market
- **Primary Audience:** "Startups to Enterprises building Internal Developer Platforms" (inferred from competitive analysis materials) with focus on startups that need compliance (FinTech, HealthTech, GovTech sectors) (Source: northflank.com competitor analysis blog, accessed Feb 2026)
- **Geographic Focus:** United States (New York-based), no evidence of African market presence or local payment support as of Feb 2026
- **Industries/Segments Called Out:**
  - FinTech: Explicitly mentioned in compliance positioning (Source: porter.run/blog/how-to-ensure-hipaa-compliance-on-aws, accessed Feb 2026)
  - HealthTech: HIPAA compliance focus (Source: porter.run/blog, porter.run/changelog, accessed Feb 2026)
  - GovTech: Mentioned in competitive materials (Source: northflank.com blog, accessed Feb 2026)

**Messaging Evidence:** 
Homepage hero copy: "Effortless app infrastructure, your own cloud. Run and scale apps in any AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure account." (Source: porter.run homepage, accessed Feb 2026)

#### Product Portfolio

**Core Platform:**
- **BYOC Platform-as-a-Service:** Kubernetes-based deployment on customer's own AWS, GCP, or Azure account (Source: porter.run homepage, accessed Feb 2026)
- **Infrastructure Provisioning:** "With a few clicks, Porter will spin up a Kubernetes cluster that's production-ready out of the box, along with other auxiliary infrastructure such as a dedicated VPC, load balancers, and image registries" (Source: porter.run homepage, accessed Feb 2026)
- **Application Deployment:** "Link up your Git Repository and let Porter handle the rest. Porter will build your application using Dockerfiles or Buildpacks and automatically configure CI/CD using GitHub Actions that you can customize later" (Source: porter.run homepage, accessed Feb 2026)

**"Instant SOC2 & HIPAA Compliance" Feature - Detailed Verification:**

This is Porter's flagship compliance differentiator. From changelog (porter.run/changelog/soc2-hipaa-aws-compliance-oneleet, accessed Feb 2026):

**What it Actually Provisions (verified from changelog):**
- **One-click automation via Oneleet (YC S22) integration:** "You can now pass all AWS infrastructure controls for SOC 2 and HIPAA on Oneleet (YC S22) with the click of a button on Porter" (Source: porter.run/changelog/soc2-hipaa-aws-compliance-oneleet, accessed Feb 2026)
- **Not a compliance certification:** Porter itself does NOT provide SOC2/HIPAA certification. The feature ensures "all infrastructure controls on a compliance management platform like Oneleet will pass instantly" (Source: porter.run/changelog/soc2-hipaa-aws-compliance-oneleet, accessed Feb 2026)
- **Also integrates with Drata:** "Drata SOC 2 Controls" mentioned in separate changelog (porter.run/changelog/aws-cost-optimization-drata-soc-2-controls-and-gpu-time-slicing-for-gcp, accessed Feb 2026)
- **Thoropass partnership:** "Porter's one-click SOC 2 / HIPAA feature makes it so all the infrastructure controls on a compliance management platform like Thoropass would pass instantly" (Source: thoropass.com/platform/integrations, accessed Feb 2026)

**Real Product Capability:**
The feature automates AWS infrastructure configuration to pass compliance platform audits (Oneleet, Drata, Thoropass). It does NOT provide instant certification, but rather ensures the underlying infrastructure is configured to meet compliance requirements.

From Porter's own blog post (porter.run/blog/how-to-ensure-hipaa-compliance-on-aws):
"Using Porter does not make you HIPAA compliant by default, but using Porter will not introduce additional compliance overhead compared to just running your own infrastructure on AWS/GCP. This is because Porter does not store or host any of our clients' end user data - all your customer data will be stored inside your AWS/GCP account and accompanying database."

**What Porter Actually Automates for Compliance:**
- "Porter can also ensure HIPAA compliance for all AWS infrastructure that is managed by Porter, including EKS, RDS, S3, and auxiliary services like Cloudwatch" (Source: porter.run/blog/how-to-ensure-hipaa-compliance-on-aws, accessed Feb 2026)
- **One infrastructure control NOT automated:** "removal of PHI in application logs. By nature, this is something that the customer will have to ensure on their own" (Source: porter.run/blog/how-to-ensure-hipaa-compliance-on-aws, accessed Feb 2026)

**Cloud Provider Support:**
- AWS: Verified (Source: porter.run homepage and changelog, accessed Feb 2026)
- GCP (Google Cloud): Verified (Source: porter.run homepage, accessed Feb 2026)
- Azure: Verified (Source: porter.run homepage, accessed Feb 2026)

**Deployment Model:**
- Kubernetes-based (EKS on AWS, GKE on GCP) - verified (Source: porter.run/blog/how-to-ensure-hipaa-compliance-on-aws mentions "securing Kubernetes", accessed Feb 2026)

**Managed Add-ons:**
- Managed databases mentioned but specific offerings not enumerated publicly as of Feb 2026

#### Pricing
(Source: porter.run website, accessed Feb 2026)

**Critical Note:** Porter's public website does NOT publish transparent pricing as of Feb 2026. No pricing page found at porter.run/pricing (returns 404 or redirect). 

**Pricing Model (from third-party sources):**
From Lago billing case study (getlago.com/blog/porter-billing):
- "Usage-based billing system" - pricing scales with consumption
- Prior to Lago implementation, Porter used "Stripe for subscriptions and handled most things manually" and was "sales-led company that mostly relied on manual enterprise agreements"
- Moved to "self-serve option" with usage-based pricing for startups

**Pricing Structure - Not Publicly Disclosed:**
The exact per-user costs, compute costs, and platform fees are NOT published on porter.run as of Feb 2026.

From AWS partnership page (porter.run/aws):
"If you're a startup, you may qualify for Porter's free for startups deal that allows for 25vCPU and 50GB RAM of free usage, lasting for 6 months."

**Per-User vs Compute Costs:** Not publicly available as of Feb 2026

**Pricing Transparency:** Pricing is gated - not published. Contact sales required.

#### Compliance Capabilities (Critical Section)

**SOC2:**
- Porter integrates with compliance platforms (Oneleet, Drata, Thoropass) to automate passing infrastructure controls (Source: porter.run/changelog, thoropass.com, accessed Feb 2026)
- **Note:** Porter the PaaS company (porter.run) is DISTINCT from Porter healthcare company (helloporter.com) which achieved SOC 2 Type 2 certification in Nov 2024. Do not conflate the two.

**HIPAA Controls:**
From porter.run/blog/how-to-ensure-hipaa-compliance-on-aws:
- **BAA (Business Associate Agreement):** "AWS offers a Business Associates Addendum (BAA) agreement" - Porter helps customers activate this
- **Infrastructure Controls Automated:**
  - VPC isolation and private networking
  - IAM roles and least-privilege access
  - Encryption at rest and in transit
  - Audit logging via CloudTrail and CloudWatch
  - Security groups and NACLs configuration
- **One Manual Control:** Removal of PHI from application logs (customer responsibility)

**Audit Logging:**
Enabled via CloudTrail integration (Source: porter.run/blog/how-to-ensure-hipaa-compliance-on-aws, accessed Feb 2026)

**Compliance Dashboards:**
Integration with Oneleet, Drata, Thoropass provides dashboards (Source: porter.run/changelog, accessed Feb 2026)

**What "Instant SOC2" Actually Does:**
Pre-configures AWS infrastructure to meet compliance platform requirements. Automated evidence collection for infrastructure controls. Does NOT provide certification - certification still requires audit by third-party auditor.

#### Go-to-Market
- **Self-Serve or Sales-Led:** Transitioned from sales-led (manual enterprise agreements) to hybrid model with self-serve option for startups (Source: getlago.com/blog/porter-billing, accessed Feb 2026)
- **Enterprise Focus:** Yes - original GTM was enterprise-focused, now expanding to self-serve for startups (Source: getlago.com/blog/porter-billing, accessed Feb 2026)
- **Developer Community:** Not publicly visible as of Feb 2026

#### Geographic Focus
- **African Market Presence:** No evidence of African cloud region targeting, local currency payment support, or African-specific marketing as of Feb 2026
- **Local Payment Support:** Not publicly available as of Feb 2026
- **African Cloud Regions:** No evidence of AWS Cape Town (af-south-1) or other African region support called out as of Feb 2026

**Messaging Evidence:**
CEO Quote: "In much of the growth market, most startups and SMEs still operate without secure automated software delivery processes, leaving them vulnerable to breaches, compliance challenges, and slow-release cycles. This funding gives us the firepower to level the playing field, so that high-growth teams, regardless of size or geography, can deploy secure, production-grade software with confidence." (Andrew Mori, Source: cioafrica.co, accessed Feb 2026)

"We built Salus so a fintech can focus on loans, an e-commerce company on logistics not on securing Kubernetes or building core banking from scratch" (Andrew Mori, Source: waya.media, accessed Feb 2026)

**Backup Features:**
"Updates & backups handled by Coolify" (Coolify Cloud tier) (Source: srvrlss.io/provider/coolify, accessed Feb 2026)

#### Pricing
(Source: coolify.io/pricing, coolify.io/self-hosted, srvrlss.io/provider/coolify, accessed Feb 2026)

**Pricing Model:** BYOS (Bring Your Own Server) - users manage and pay for servers separately, Coolify software is free (self-hosted) or low-cost managed service (Cloud)

**Tiers:**

1. **Self-Hosted**
   - Price: **$0 Forever** (Free)
   - Full access to all features
   - "Need your own infrastructure for Coolify"
   - No limitation or restrictions
   - Community support (19k+ members noted in some materials)
   - Automated or self-managed updates
   - Includes all upcoming features
   - (Source: coolify.io/pricing, accessed Feb 2026)

2. **Coolify Cloud**
   - Base Price: **$5/month** (includes 2 connected servers)
   - **$3/month per additional server** (Source: coolify.io/pricing, srvrlss.io, accessed Feb 2026)
   - Features:
     - Connect unlimited servers
     - Unlimited deployments per server
     - Free email alerts for Coolify events
     - Community + limited email support
     - Founder-tested updates
     - Coolify runs on Coolify's managed infrastructure (user's apps still run on user's own servers)
   - (Source: coolify.io/pricing, accessed Feb 2026)

**What's Included in Cloud vs Self-Hosted:**

| Feature | Self-Hosted | Cloud |
|---------|-------------|-------|
| Application Deployments | ✓ | ✓ |
| Database Deployments | ✓ | ✓ |
| Service/One-click Deployments | ✓ | ✓ |
| API Access | ✓ | ✓ |
| Codebase | Open source | Open source |
| Coolify Hosting | Self-managed | Managed |
| Coolify Dashboard Domain | Custom Domain | app.coolify.io |

**Server Cost Clarification:**
"Self-hosting requires one server for Coolify and at least one more for your deployments, as recommended. Each server costs around $5 per month." - This is the VPS cost from providers like Hetzner/DigitalOcean, NOT Coolify's charge. Coolify Cloud at $5/month is comparable to self-hosting cost once server expenses are factored in. (Source: coolify.io/cloud, accessed Feb 2026)

**Managed/Cloud Offering:**
Yes - Coolify Cloud is the managed offering where Coolify dashboard runs on Coolify's infrastructure, but user still brings own servers for app deployments

**Difference Between Self-Hosted Free and Paid Tier:**
- Self-hosted: User manages both Coolify instance AND application servers
- Cloud: Coolify manages the Coolify dashboard/control plane, user only manages application servers
- Features are identical (open-source codebase), difference is in operational burden

#### Community Traction

**GitHub Metrics:**
Not provided in accessed search results as of Feb 2026. Would require direct GitHub repository check.

**Community Size:**
- "Community support (19+ members)" mentioned in one source (appears to be typo, likely 19k+ or similar)
- Discord/Forum presence implied but specific member counts not provided

**Release Cadence:**
"Founder-tested updates" for Cloud tier suggests active development, but specific release frequency not disclosed publicly

#### Limitations

**From Third-Party Analysis and Community:**
(Source: srvrlss.io/provider/coolify, accessed Feb 2026)

"Our Take on Coolify" from srvrlss.io:
- "Scaling stops at Docker Swarm" - limited orchestration beyond Docker Swarm
- "Some apps need manual fixes" - not all applications deploy seamlessly
- "The docs might not help you there" - documentation gaps
- "It's a solid foundation that takes a bit of work to grow"
- "No lock-in. No black boxes. No hidden pricing. You own the stack, and the learning curve that comes with it."

**No SLA:**
Self-hosted = no SLA (user responsible)
Cloud tier = no SLA published as of Feb 2026

**No Commercial Support:**
"Community support" and "limited email support" for Cloud tier - no enterprise/commercial support tier available

**Complexity of Self-Hosting:**
Requires server management skills, SSH access, understanding of Docker
"takes a bit of work to grow" - setup and scaling requires technical knowledge

**User-Reported Pain Points:**
Not explicitly documented in accessed materials, would require GitHub issues review or community forum analysis

**African Region Support:**

**Pricing Predictability Concerns:**
From third-party analysis:
- "Railway's $5 trial credit can run out quickly, especially if your app needs to run 24/7" (Source: northflank.com/blog/railway-alternatives, accessed Feb 2026)
- "Apps stop running when usage credits are used up, even on Hobby plan. Requires paid plan to stay online" (Source: northflank.com/blog/railway-vs-render, accessed Feb 2026)
- Usage-based billing requires "manual credit monitoring" (Source: northflank.com/blog/railway-vs-render, accessed Feb 2026)

**Other Limitations:**
- "Not ideal for long-running services with fixed pricing" - better suited for variable workloads (Source: northflank.com/blog/railway-vs-render, accessed Feb 2026)
- Background workers and observability require "manual setup" unlike Render's built-in support (Source: northflank.com/blog/railway-vs-render, accessed Feb 2026)
